# Scribe Fixes Summary

## Issues Fixed:

### 1. Bash Compatibility (FIXED)
- **Problem**: `wait -n -p` is not supported in bash 3.2 (macOS default)
- **Solution**: Replaced with polling approach using `kill -0` to check process status
- **Impact**: Now works on all bash versions including macOS

### 2. Worker Spawning Logic (FIXED)
- **Problem**: Worker directories weren't created for all tasks when rate limited
- **Solution**: Create all worker directories upfront before spawning
- **Impact**: No more "unknown" status for unspawned workers

### 3. Worker Status Initialization (FIXED)
- **Problem**: Missing status files caused "unknown" states
- **Solution**: Initialize status.json with "pending" state for all tasks
- **Impact**: Better status tracking in monitor command

### 4. Claude Code Automation (IMPROVED)
- **Problem**: Claude only provides recommendations instead of making changes
- **Solutions implemented**:
  - Added `--dangerously-skip-permissions` flag
  - Pre-approved tools: `Bash,Read,Edit,Write,Grep,Glob,LS,MultiEdit`
  - Made prompts more directive and explicit
  - Added verification to detect when Claude only gives recommendations
  - Increased max turns to 30 for complex tasks

## Testing the Fixes:

Run the following command to test:
```bash
scribe issue -n 1 --scope frontend --priority low --workers 1 --strategy single-pr --yes
```

Monitor progress with:
```bash
scribe monitor
```

## Known Limitations:

1. Claude Code may still sometimes only provide recommendations despite our prompts
2. The `--allowedTools` flag may need adjustment based on Claude Code version
3. Some complex tasks may require manual intervention

## Next Steps:

If Claude continues to only provide recommendations:
1. Check Claude Code logs for specific tool permission issues
2. Consider using `--permission-mode` flag
3. May need to create custom Claude Code configuration file
